## TROUBLESHOOTING: COMMON WEEK 1-4 ISSUES

### Issue #1: Wholesalers Not Responding

**Solution**:
- Follow up with phone calls (many small wholesalers prefer phone over email)
- Try different wholesalers (you need to contact 20+ to get 5-10 responsive ones)
- Join wholesale sourcing communities (Facebook groups, Reddit) to find leads

---

### Issue #2: All Good Products Are Gated

**Solution**:
- Focus on ungated categories first (office, home/kitchen non-brand, pet supplies non-brand)
- Apply for ungating with proper documentation (authorization letters + invoices)
- Start with ungated products to build cash flow, then tackle gated categories

---

### Issue #3: Margins Aren't As Good As Expected

**Solution**:
- Double-check fee calculations (use Amazon's FBA Revenue Calculator)
- Factor in ALL costs (shipping, prep, storage, returns)
- Adjust pricing if you can (raise price slightly if you're winning Buy Box)
- If margins are truly thin, move on to different products

---

### Issue #4: Products Not Selling As Fast As Jungle Scout Predicted

**Solution**:
- Sales estimates are estimates, not guarantees
- Give it 2-3 weeks before judging
- Check if you're winning Buy Box (if not, lower price slightly)
- Verify BSR hasn't spiked (product demand may have dropped)
- If still slow after 30 days, liquidate and move on

---

### Issue #5: Got Suspended / Inauthentic Claim

**Solution**:
- **DO NOT PANIC** - this is resolvable if you have proper documentation
- Gather invoices from your wholesaler showing:
  - Supplier name, your name, product details, quantities, dates
- Provide authorization letters (if you have them)
- Write a Plan of Action (POA) to Amazon explaining:
  - Where you sourced the product (authorized distributor)
  - How you verified authenticity (UPC match, direct from supplier)
  - Steps you've taken to prevent future issues
- Submit via Seller Central > Performance > Account Health > Appeal
- Most suspensions are lifted within 1-7 days if documentation is solid

---
