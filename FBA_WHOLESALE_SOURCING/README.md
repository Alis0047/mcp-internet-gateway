## 🎓 Core Compliance Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**These rules protect your Amazon account and business:**

### Rule #1: 100% Exact Product Match
- Only sell products that are **identical** to the Amazon listing
- Same brand, same model, same UPC, same pack count, same packaging
- "Close enough" = account suspension

### Rule #2: Only Authorized Sources
- Only buy from manufacturers, authorized distributors, or reputable wholesalers
- NO gray market, NO retail arbitrage
- Keep all invoices (you may need them months later)

### Rule #3: Never Violate Policies
- No fake invoices, no fake authorization letters
- Follow MAP policies if they exist
- If a category/brand is gated, get proper approval BEFORE buying inventory

### Rule #4: Document Everything
- Save all invoices (must meet Amazon's requirements)
- Keep authorization letters on file
- Track all orders and expenses

### Rule #5: US-Based Suppliers First
- Prioritize US wholesalers for easier logistics and documentation
- International suppliers = more complexity (customs, shipping, documentation)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Not Verifying UPC Match
**Problem**: Selling the wrong product on a listing (e.g., 6-pack instead of single unit)
**Result**: Account suspension, returns, complaints
**Solution**: Use 03_UPC_TO_ASIN_MATCHING_GUIDE.md and verify EVERY detail

### Mistake #2: Skipping Demand Validation
**Problem**: Buying inventory for a product with low/no demand
**Result**: Slow/no sales, cash tied up, storage fees
**Solution**: Use Jungle Scout to verify 100+ units/month sales BEFORE buying

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Risk Assessment
**Problem**: Buying counterfeit-prone, gated, or high-return products
**Result**: Account issues, financial losses
**Solution**: Use 05_RISK_ASSESSMENT_FRAMEWORK.md for every product

### Mistake #4: Chasing "Too Good to Be True" Deals
**Problem**: Liquidation, overstock, or "exclusive" deals that sound amazing
**Result**: Defective products, used items sold as new, no demand
**Solution**: Stick to authorized distributors with proven track records

### Mistake #5: Not Keeping Documentation
**Problem**: Can't prove authenticity when Amazon requests it
**Result**: Account suspension
**Solution**: Save ALL invoices, authorization letters, and correspondence
