## TRAP #1: Price War Products - Vitamax Multivitamins Example

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Generic multivitamin supplements (50+ brands on Amazon selling similar products)
- **ASIN Example**: Various (highly competitive space)
- **Wholesale Cost**: $8-12 per bottle
- **Amazon Price 6 months ago**: $24.99
- **Amazon Price Today**: $14.99
- **Number of Sellers**: 25+

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- 150% markup from wholesale cost
- High search volume for "multivitamins"
- Estimated 1,000+ units/month sales

❌ **The reality**:
- Fierce price competition from 25+ sellers
- Price has dropped 40% in 6 months
- Many sellers now selling at or below wholesale cost (trying to liquidate)
- Race to the bottom - margins have collapsed
- Supplements are also gated (Health & Personal Care category) and have high return rates due to personal preference

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Products with 15+ sellers and declining price trends (>15% drop in 90 days), especially in gated categories with high return potential.

## TRAP #2: Counterfeit-Prone Electronics - "Apple iPhone Chargers"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Apple Lightning cables, MFi certified (or claiming to be)
- **ASIN Example**: Various
- **Wholesale Cost**: $3-8 per cable
- **Amazon Price**: $12-20
- **Estimated Margin**: Looks like 100-200%

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- High demand (everyone needs iPhone chargers)
- Huge search volume
- Low cost, small/light (low FBA fees)

❌ **The reality**:
- Market flooded with counterfeits (fake MFi certification)
- Even legitimate products get flagged due to commingled inventory risk
- Apple is hypervigilant about unauthorized sellers
- High inauthentic complaint rate
- Account suspension risk is EXTREMELY high
- Customer complaints about "not working" or "stopped charging after 2 weeks"

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Apple accessories, branded phone accessories, and any category where counterfeits are rampant, even if your source is legitimate. The risk isn't worth it.

## TRAP #3: Seasonal Spike Product - "Christmas Tree Ornaments"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Generic Christmas ornaments
- **ASIN Example**: Various
- **Wholesale Cost**: $5-10 per set
- **Amazon Price (November)**: $25-30
- **Estimated Sales (November)**: 500 units/month

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- High demand in Q4
- Good margins during peak season
- Jungle Scout shows 500 units/month

❌ **The reality**:
- Sales are ONLY during Oct-Dec (8-10 weeks/year)
- Jungle Scout average includes off-season (Jan-Sep = 10-20 units/month, then Nov-Dec = 2,000 units/month)
- If you order in August for Christmas, you pay storage fees Sep-Dec
- If you don't sell out by Dec 25, you're stuck with inventory for 10 months
- Aged inventory fees start racking up
- You'll be forced to liquidate at a loss in January

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Highly seasonal products unless you have very accurate sales forecasting and can time orders perfectly. Even then, one miscalculation = major losses.

**Exception**: Seasonal products are OK if:
- You order just-in-time (2-3 months before peak)
- Margins are 50%+ to absorb storage fees
- You have a liquidation plan (clearance listings, donation, return to supplier)

## TRAP #4: Fragile Items - "Glass Jar Canisters"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Glass kitchen canisters (set of 4)
- **ASIN Example**: Various
- **Wholesale Cost**: $12 per set
- **Amazon Price**: $35
- **Estimated Sales**: 200 units/month
- **Calculated Margin**: 40%

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- Great margins
- Decent sales volume
- Popular home & kitchen category

❌ **The reality**:
- 15-20% breakage rate during:
  - Shipping from supplier to you
  - Your prep process
  - Shipping to Amazon FBA
  - FBA warehouse handling
- High return rate (10-15%) due to breakage during delivery to customer
- Customer complaints and negative feedback
- Amazon may charge you for "unsellable inventory" (broken units)
- Your actual margin after accounting for breakage/returns: 15-20%

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Fragile glass, ceramics, mirrors, or delicate items unless:
- Margins are 60%+ to absorb breakage/return costs
- Supplier provides excellent packaging
- You're prepared to deal with constant customer complaints

---

## TRAP #5: Hijacked Listing - "Yeti Rambler Tumbler"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Yeti Rambler 20oz Tumbler
- **ASIN**: B01N0W6DTB (example)
- **Wholesale Cost**: $18-22 (from various "wholesalers")
- **Amazon Price**: $29.99-34.99
- **Estimated Sales**: 1,000+ units/month

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- Premium brand with high demand
- Established listing with 15,000+ reviews
- Decent margin (30-40%)

❌ **The reality**:
- Yeti is VERY restrictive about who can sell on Amazon
- Most "wholesalers" offering Yeti are NOT authorized
- If you're not an authorized Yeti distributor, you'll get:
  - IP complaints
  - Account suspension
  - Inventory seized by Amazon
- Even if your source CLAIMS they're authorized, Yeti will verify and often deny it
- Countless sellers have been suspended trying to sell Yeti

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Premium brands with strict distribution controls (Yeti, Hydro Flask, RTIC, OtterBox, LEGO, Apple, Nike, etc.) unless you can get DIRECT authorization from the brand (not just the wholesaler).

**Red Flag**: If a "wholesaler" is offering you Yeti at low prices and no authorization documentation, they are NOT legit.

## TRAP #6: Gray Market Products - "Sony Camera Lenses (International Version)"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Sony FE 50mm f/1.8 Lens (gray market import)
- **Wholesale Cost**: $180
- **Amazon Listing Price**: $248
- **Margin Calculation**: $68 profit (27%)

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- Premium electronics with steady demand
- 27% margin is decent for electronics

❌ **The reality**:
- "International version" = gray market (imported from another region, not authorized for US market)
- No US warranty (Sony won't honor it)
- Customers expect US version with US warranty
- High return rate when customers discover it's international version
- Potential inauthenticity claims
- Amazon may suspend you for selling international versions on US listings meant for US versions
- Even if the ASIN says "International," customers often don't realize what that means until it arrives

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Gray market products (international versions, imports without US warranty) even if they're technically "authentic." Customers expect US versions with full warranty.

**Exception**: If the ASIN specifically states "International Version" and you disclose this clearly, *some* customers knowingly buy it. But risk is still higher.

## TRAP #7: MAP Violation Trap - "Ninja Blender BN701"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Ninja Professional Plus Blender (BN701)
- **ASIN**: B08K34DRMT (example)
- **Wholesale Cost**: $60
- **MAP (Minimum Advertised Price)**: $99.99
- **Actual Amazon Listing Price**: $79.99 (sellers undercutting MAP)

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- Well-known brand
- 30%+ margin at MAP price
- High demand

❌ **The reality**:
- Multiple sellers are violating MAP and selling at $79.99
- If you price at MAP ($99.99), you won't win Buy Box (no sales)
- If you price at $79.99 to compete, you violate MAP
- MAP violation consequences:
  - Supplier cuts you off (no more supply)
  - Brand reports you to Amazon (potential suspension)
- You're stuck between: (A) follow MAP and don't sell, or (B) violate MAP and lose your supplier

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Products where MAP is being violated by multiple sellers. The enforcement is inconsistent, and you'll either not sell (if you follow MAP) or risk losing your supplier (if you violate MAP).

**Better**: Find products where MAP is actually enforced, or products with no MAP policy.

## TRAP #8: Hazmat Fees Kill Margins - "WD-40 Spray (Aerosol)"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: WD-40 Multi-Use Product, 12oz aerosol can
- **Wholesale Cost**: $3.50
- **Amazon Price**: $8.99
- **Estimated Margin (before hazmat fees)**: 40%+

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- Household staple, high demand
- Low wholesale cost
- Good margin calculation

❌ **The reality**:
- Aerosol = Hazmat (Dangerous Goods)
- Amazon FBA Hazmat fees are MUCH higher:
  - Regular FBA fee for 12oz item: ~$4
  - Hazmat FBA fee: ~$6-7 (50%+ higher)
- Storage fees are higher for hazmat
- Slower receiving times at FBA (hazmat products go to specialized warehouses)
- Restrictions during Q4 peak season (some hazmat not accepted)
- After accounting for higher fees, margin drops to 15-20%

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Hazmat products (aerosols, flammable liquids, lithium batteries, strong magnets) unless margins are 50%+ to absorb the higher fees.

**How to Check**: In Seller Central, search the ASIN and look for "Dangerous Goods" badge, or upload to FBA and Amazon will flag it.

## TRAP #9: Too Many Sellers / Wholesaler Dump - "Generic Phone Stand"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Generic aluminum phone stand
- **ASIN**: Various
- **Wholesale Cost**: $4
- **Amazon Price 3 months ago**: $18.99
- **Amazon Price Today**: $9.99
- **Number of Sellers**: 30+

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- Low cost, simple product
- Small/light (low FBA fees)
- High search volume

❌ **The reality**:
- Wholesaler is dumping inventory (they or many others flooded Amazon with this SKU)
- 30+ sellers all competing
- Price has collapsed from $18.99 to $9.99 in 90 days
- At $9.99, margin is near zero or negative
- This is an "overexposed" product (too many sellers got access to the same wholesale source)

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Products where:
- 20+ sellers on listing
- Price has dropped >30% in 90 days
- Wholesaler is offering it to EVERYONE (if it's easy for you to get, it's easy for 100 other sellers to get)

**Better**: Find products with 1-5 sellers (limited distribution), or products where the wholesaler vets resellers carefully.

## TRAP #10: "Private Label" Disguised as Wholesale - "Random Chinese Brand"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: "ZXYABC Brand Silicone Spatulas" (made-up brand name)
- **ASIN**: New listing, 5 reviews
- **Wholesale Cost**: $2
- **Amazon Price**: $12.99
- **Supplier Claims**: "Exclusive wholesale deal!"

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- High margins (85%+)
- Exclusive deal
- Supplier is enthusiastic

❌ **The reality**:
- This is NOT wholesale, it's private label (or white label)
- The "brand" is a generic Chinese product relabeled
- The listing is new with minimal reviews (no demand validation)
- You're being asked to basically launch the product for them
- Risk:
  - Product may not sell (unproven demand)
  - You're paying "wholesale" prices for what is essentially private label
  - Quality may be inconsistent
  - If it DOES sell well, the "wholesaler" will list it themselves or sell to 50 other people

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: "Wholesale" deals on unknown Chinese brands with no track record. This is private label disguised as wholesale.

**Real Wholesale**:
- Established brands with existing Amazon demand
- Listings with 100+ reviews
- Multiple years of sales history
- Recognizable brand name

## TRAP #11: Return Rate Nightmare - "Shapewear / Compression Garments"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Women's shapewear / body shaper
- **ASIN**: Various
- **Wholesale Cost**: $8-12
- **Amazon Price**: $25-35
- **Estimated Margin**: 40%

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- High margins
- Consumable/repeat purchase category
- High search volume

❌ **The reality**:
- Apparel/shapewear has 25-40% return rate
- Sizing issues (runs small/large)
- Fit/comfort complaints
- "Not as expected" returns
- For every 10 units sold:
  - 3-4 returns
  - Amazon charges you return shipping + restocking
  - Returns often damaged/worn (unsellable)
- Actual margin after returns: 15-20%

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Apparel, especially sizing-sensitive items (shapewear, bras, shoes) unless margins are 60%+ to absorb high return rates.

**Better**: Stick to "one size fits all" or non-sizing categories (pet, office, home/kitchen, tools).

---

## TRAP #12: Used/Refurbished Sold As New - "Overstock Liquidation"

### Product Profile:
- **Product**: Blender (major brand), "overstock liquidation"
- **Wholesale Cost**: $25 (50% below normal wholesale)
- **Amazon Price**: $89.99
- **Margin**: Looks amazing (70%+)

### Why This Is a Trap:
✅ **Looks good initially**:
- Incredible margins
- Major brand
- Supplier says "brand new, just overstock"

❌ **The reality**:
- Many "overstock" or "liquidation" deals include:
  - Customer returns (used/opened)
  - Refurbished units (not disclosed)
  - Damaged packaging
  - Missing parts
- If you list these as "New" on Amazon:
  - High defect rate → complaints
  - "Used product sold as new" claims
  - Account suspension
- Even if SOME units are new, you can't easily verify which ones, and inconsistent quality = customer complaints

### The Lesson:
**AVOID**: Liquidation/overstock deals unless:
- You can physically inspect every unit
- Supplier guarantees they are NEW (not returns/refurbished)
- You're buying from a reputable liquidation company (B-Stock, Bulq, Direct Liquidation) and listing as "Used" on Amazon (if applicable)

**For FBA wholesale, stick to brand-new products from authorized distributors.**
