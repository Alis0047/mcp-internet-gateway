# Risk Assessment Framework - Wholesale Product Screening

## Overview
This framework helps you identify and avoid high-risk products that could result in account suspension, legal issues, financial losses, or customer complaints.

**Rule**: When in doubt, skip the product. There are thousands of opportunities - don't risk your account on a questionable one.

## RISK CATEGORY 1: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) RISK

### 🚨 HIGH RISK - AVOID

❌ **Brands Known for Aggressive IP Enforcement**:
- Nike, Adidas, Under Armour (apparel/footwear)
- Apple, Samsung, Sony (electronics)
- LEGO, Disney, Marvel (toys/licensed products)
- Yeti, Hydro Flask (drinkware - many counterfeit claims)
- RTIC (actively pursues unauthorized sellers)
- Ray-Ban, Oakley (sunglasses)
- Beats by Dre (audio)
- Supreme, North Face (apparel)

**Why risky**: These brands frequently file IP complaints, suspend seller accounts, and require extensive authorization documentation.

❌ **Licensed Characters/Properties**:
- Disney characters (Mickey, Frozen, Marvel, Star Wars)
- Nintendo (Mario, Pokemon, Zelda)
- Warner Bros (Harry Potter, DC Comics, Looney Tunes)
- Any sports team logos (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL)

**Why risky**: Requires explicit licensing agreements. Unauthorized resellers get immediate suspension.

❌ **Counterfeit-Prone Categories**:
- Designer handbags/wallets
- Luxury watches
- High-end cosmetics (MAC, Urban Decay, Too Faced)
- Premium electronics accessories (Apple chargers, AirPods, etc.)

**Why risky**: Amazon is hypersensitive to counterfeits in these categories. Even legitimate products face scrutiny.

### ⚠️ MODERATE RISK - PROCEED WITH CAUTION

⚠️ **Brands Requiring Authorization (but obtainable)**:
- Hasbro, Mattel, Melissa & Doug (toys)
- OXO, KitchenAid, Cuisinart (kitchen)
- Black+Decker, DeWalt, Milwaukee (tools - some SKUs)
- Melissa & Doug, Fisher-Price (baby/toys)

**How to mitigate**:
1. ✅ Get authorization letter from wholesaler (on their letterhead)
2. ✅ Ensure invoices show supplier name, your name, product details
3. ✅ Submit for approval BEFORE buying inventory
4. ✅ Keep all documentation organized

### ✅ LOW RISK - GENERALLY SAFE

✅ **Generic/Unbranded Products**:
- Small unknown brands
- Amazon Basics (if you're approved)
- Store brands from authorized distributors

✅ **Your Own Private Label Products**:
- If you're the brand owner and registered on Amazon Brand Registry

---

## RISK CATEGORY 2: RETURN RISK

### 🚨 HIGH RISK - AVOID OR MINIMIZE

❌ **High Return Rate Categories** (>20% returns):
- **Apparel & Shoes**: Sizing issues, fit, style mismatches (20-30% return rate)
- **Consumer Electronics**: Defects, buyer's remorse, compatibility issues (15-25%)
- **Home Décor**: Style/color didn't match expectations (15-20%)
- **Personal Care Appliances**: Performance doesn't meet expectations (15-20%)

❌ **Fragile/Breakage-Prone Items**:
- Glass jars, glassware, ceramics
- Mirrors, picture frames with glass
- Delicate decorative items

**Why risky**: Amazon FBA handling can be rough. High breakage = high returns + refund costs.

❌ **Complex Assembly Required**:
- Furniture requiring extensive assembly
- Multi-component electronics systems

**Why risky**: Customers often return due to difficulty assembling, missing parts, or confusion.

### ⚠️ MODERATE RISK

⚠️ **Products with Sizing/Fit Issues**:
- Pet collars, harnesses (if size chart is unclear)
- Some baby products (bottles, pacifiers - personal preference)

**How to mitigate**:
- Ensure listing has accurate size chart
- Read reviews - if many mention "runs small" or "doesn't fit," skip it

⚠️ **Seasonal Products Outside Season**:
- Christmas decorations in February
- Pool supplies in November

**How to mitigate**:
- Only buy seasonal products 2-3 months before peak season
- Avoid buying large quantities out-of-season (storage fees accumulate)

### ✅ LOW RISK

✅ **Consumables with Clear Use Case**:
- Pet treats, grooming supplies
- Office supplies (pens, paper, folders)
- Household cleaning supplies

✅ **Durable Goods, Simple Use**:
- Basic kitchen tools (spatulas, tongs, measuring cups)
- Basic hand tools
- Simple storage containers

---

## RISK CATEGORY 3: PRICE WAR RISK

### 🚨 HIGH RISK - SKIP

❌ **Signs of Active Price War**:
- Price has dropped >20% in the last 90 days (Keepa chart shows steep decline)
- 15+ sellers on the listing
- Buy Box price changes daily
- Many sellers at or below wholesale cost (checked via CamelCamelCamel or Keepa)

**Why risky**: You'll be forced to drop price to compete, eroding margins. May even sell at a loss.

❌ **Wholesaler is Also Selling on Amazon**:
- Check seller list on the ASIN
- Google the wholesaler name + "Amazon seller"

**Why risky**: Wholesaler undercuts you with their own direct sales. You can't compete with their pricing.

❌ **Too Many FBA Sellers (10+) with Low Differentiation**:
- Generic product
- No brand loyalty
- Pure price competition

**Why risky**: Race to the bottom. Margins collapse.

### ⚠️ MODERATE RISK

⚠️ **5-9 Sellers on Listing**:
- Manageable competition IF:
  - Your margins support a 10-15% price drop buffer
  - Product has strong demand (500+ units/month)
  - MAP policy exists (prevents undercutting)

**How to mitigate**:
- Confirm MAP policy with wholesaler
- Ensure your supplier is authorized (prevents gray market undercutting)
- Monitor competition weekly via Keepa

### ✅ LOW RISK

✅ **1-3 Sellers**:
- Low competition
- Stable pricing
- MAP policy in place (confirmed)

✅ **MAP Enforced Products**:
- Brand actively enforces MAP (Minimum Advertised Price)
- Violators get their supply cut off
- Protects margins

**How to verify MAP**:
- Ask wholesaler: "Does this brand have a MAP policy?"
- Check brand's website for reseller policies
- Google: "[Brand Name] MAP policy"

---

## RISK CATEGORY 4: COUNTERFEIT RISK

### 🚨 HIGH RISK - ONLY BUY FROM MANUFACTURER/AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR

❌ **Categories Flooded with Counterfeits**:
- Phone accessories (especially Apple Lightning cables, AirPods, chargers)
- Cosmetics (especially luxury brands)
- Designer apparel/accessories
- SD cards, USB drives (many fakes on Amazon)
- Batteries (especially brand names like Duracell, Energizer)

**Why risky**: Even if YOUR product is authentic, customers may receive a counterfeit from another seller (commingled inventory), and you get blamed.

### ⚠️ MODERATE RISK

⚠️ **Products with No Brand Authentication**:
- Generic products from Alibaba/AliExpress wholesalers
- "White label" products with suspicious branding

**How to mitigate**:
1. ✅ Verify wholesaler is authorized by the brand (call the brand directly)
2. ✅ Request authorization letter from brand
3. ✅ Use "Stickerless, Commingled Inventory" = NO (always label your own inventory to avoid commingling)

### ✅ LOW RISK

✅ **Direct from Manufacturer**:
- You're buying directly from the brand owner
- Clear chain of custody

✅ **Authorized Distributor with Documentation**:
- Wholesaler provides authorization letter from brand
- Invoices meet Amazon requirements

---

- Grocery & Gourmet Food: Gated category (requires approval)
- Dietary supplements: Highly regulated, requires approval
- Topical skin products (lotions, creams): Gated under Health & Personal Care

**Why risky**: Heavy regulation, liability concerns, expiration date management.

❌ **Recalled Products**:
- Check CPSC.gov (Consumer Product Safety Commission) for recalls

### ⚠️ MODERATE RISK

⚠️ **Meltable Products** (Chocolate, Candles, Wax Melts):
- Amazon has seasonal restrictions (won't accept during summer in hot regions)
- Higher return rates due to melting during shipping

**How to mitigate**:
- Only sell during cool months (Oct-April in most US regions)
- Ensure "Prep Required" by Amazon (cold packs, insulation)

### ✅ LOW RISK

✅ **Standard Products**:
- No batteries
- Not flammable

**How to mitigate**:
1. Check if gated BEFORE buying inventory
2. Apply for approval with proper documentation from your wholesaler
3. Wait for approval before ordering

### ✅ LOW RISK

✅ **Ungated Categories & Brands**:
- Office products
- Home & Kitchen (most)
- Pet Supplies (most)
- Sports & Outdoors (most non-brand items)
- Tools & Home Improvement (most)

❌ **Inauthentic Claims (Most Common Suspension Reason)**:
Triggered by:
- Counterfeit products (even if yours is real, commingled inventory risk)
- Used products sold as new

### ⚠️ MODERATE RISK

⚠️ **High Return Rate**:
- Amazon may suspend your ability to sell a product if return rate >10-15%
- Triggers account review if overall return rate is high

**How to mitigate**:
- Monitor return reasons via Seller Central > Returns
- If pattern emerges (e.g., "defective"), stop ordering that SKU

### ✅ LOW RISK

✅ **Simple, Durable, Authentic Products from Authorized Distributors**:
- Clear provenance
