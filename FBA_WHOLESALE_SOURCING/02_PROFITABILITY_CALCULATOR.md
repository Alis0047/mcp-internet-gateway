Selling Price (Buy Box):         $______
- Total Landed Cost:             $______
- Total Amazon Fees:             $______

```

---

## STEP 4: MARGIN & ROI ANALYSIS

### Net Margin %
```
Net Profit per Unit: $______
÷ Selling Price: $______
× 100

= NET MARGIN %: ______%
```

**TARGET**: 30-40% minimum

### ROI %
```
Net Profit per Unit: $______
÷ Total Landed Cost: $______
× 100

= ROI %: ______%
```

**Good Benchmark**: 50%+ ROI

### Break-Even Analysis
```
Total Landed Cost + Amazon Fees = $______

This is your break-even price (absolute minimum selling price to not lose money)
```

**Rule**: Break-even should be at least 30% below current Buy Box price to provide margin buffer for price fluctuations

## STEP 5: RETURNS & RISK BUFFER

### Estimated Returns
```
Category Average Return Rate: ______%
(Apparel: 15-30%, Electronics: 10-15%, Home/Kitchen: 5-10%, Pet: 3-8%)

Expected returns cost per unit:
Net Profit per Unit × Return Rate = $______
