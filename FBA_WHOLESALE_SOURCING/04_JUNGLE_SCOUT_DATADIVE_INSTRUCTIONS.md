## ANALYSIS PRIORITY - Focus on These ASINs First:

Based on your wholesaler catalog, prioritize gathering data for products that:
1. ✅ Wholesale cost is <30% of expected selling price (rough margin check)
2. ✅ Recognizable brand (not generic Chinese brands)
3. ✅ Category matches your targets (pet, home/kitchen, tools, sports, office, automotive, beauty)
4. ✅ Product weight/size is reasonable (<5 lbs preferred for FBA fees)
5. ✅ Not hazmat, not fragile glass, not meltable

**Start with 20-30 ASINs**. I'll analyze those and give you a Top 10 priority list. Then we'll expand from there.

---

## QUICK CHECKLIST FOR EACH ASIN:

- [ ] Jungle Scout: Est. monthly sales ≥100 units
- [ ] Jungle Scout: Stable or growing trend (not declining)
- [ ] Jungle Scout: ≤10 sellers (preferred)
- [ ] Keepa: Price stable (±10% over 90 days)
- [ ] Keepa: BSR stable or improving
- [ ] DataDive: Main keyword has 1,000+ monthly searches
- [ ] DataDive: Keyword is stable (not seasonal spike)
- [ ] Cerebro: ASIN ranks for 30+ relevant keywords
- [ ] Seller Central: Product is ungated OR clear path to approval
- [ ] Profitability: 30%+ net margin (use calculator)

If all boxes are checked ✅ → **HIGH PRIORITY OPPORTUNITY**

---

## TIME ESTIMATE:

- Per ASIN (manual): ~10-15 minutes
- Bulk export (20+ ASINs): ~30 minutes total

**Suggested workflow**:
1. Day 1: Collect Jungle Scout data for 20 ASINs (export CSV) - 30 min
2. Day 2: Collect DataDive keyword data for top 10 ASINs from Day 1 - 1 hour
3. Day 3: Review Keepa charts for top 10 ASINs - 30 min
4. Day 4: Check gating status for top 10 ASINs - 20 min

**Total: ~2.5 hours to fully vet 10 high-potential products**

---

## NEXT STEP:

Once you've collected data for 10-20 ASINs, send me:
1. Completed spreadsheet OR individual data forms
2. Screenshots (optional but helpful)

I'll then:
✅ Calculate exact profitability for each
✅ Rank them by priority
✅ Identify red flags
✅ Give you the Top 10 to proceed with supplier outreach
