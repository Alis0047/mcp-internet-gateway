## PHASE 3: REQUESTING AUTHORIZATION LETTERS (For Gated Brands)

### Email Template: Authorization Letter Request

**Subject**: Authorization Letter Request - [Brand Name] - [Your Business Name]

**Email Body**:

```
Hello [Wholesaler Contact Name],

Thank you for approving my wholesale account! I'm excited to start working with you.

Before I place my first order, I wanted to confirm: some of the brands in your catalog are gated on Amazon (require approval to sell). To get ungated, Amazon requires an authorization letter from the supplier or distributor.

GATED BRANDS I'M INTERESTED IN:
- [Brand Name 1]
- [Brand Name 2]
- [Brand Name 3]

AMAZON'S REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORIZATION LETTERS:
- Must be on your company letterhead
- Must include:
  - My business name: [Your Business Name]
  - Statement that I am authorized to resell [Brand Name] products
  - Your company name and contact information
  - Signature from authorized representative
  - Date

Can you provide authorization letters for these brands? If you have a standard template you use for Amazon sellers, that would be perfect.

Additionally, Amazon requires compliant invoices for approval:
- Invoices must show:
  - Supplier name and address
  - Buyer name and address (my business info)
  - Date of purchase
  - Product names, quantities, and prices
  - Invoice number

Can you confirm your invoices meet these requirements?

Once I have the authorization letters, I'll submit them to Amazon for approval and then place my order.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Business Name]
[Your Email]
[Your Phone Number]

## COMMON OBJECTIONS & HOW TO HANDLE THEM

### Objection #1: "We don't work with Amazon sellers."

**Response**:
"I understand. Many suppliers have had issues with Amazon sellers in the past. I want to assure you that I operate professionally:
- I follow all MAP policies
- I maintain proper documentation
- I don't undercut pricing or engage in price wars
- I'm looking for long-term partnerships, not quick flips

If you're open to it, I'd love to start with a small trial order to demonstrate my professionalism. If you have any concerns or requirements, I'm happy to accommodate them."

---

### Objection #2: "Our minimum order is $5,000."

**Response**:
"I appreciate you sharing that. I'm definitely interested in reaching that volume as we scale. Would it be possible to start with a smaller initial order (perhaps $2,000-3,000) to test the products? Once I verify demand and performance, I'd be happy to commit to regular $5,000+ orders."

---

### Objection #3: "We already have sellers on Amazon for these products."

**Response**:
"That's actually great to hear - it confirms there's demand for these products on Amazon. I'm not looking to undercut existing sellers or cause pricing issues. I follow MAP policies and focus on providing excellent customer service. There's typically room for multiple sellers on successful listings, and I'd love to be part of that. Can we discuss moving forward with an account?"

---

### Objection #4: "You need a retail store / website to open an account."

**Response**:
"I understand. My primary sales channel is Amazon.com, which is where the majority of online retail happens today. Amazon handles the fulfillment, customer service, and payments, which allows me to focus on sourcing quality products from suppliers like you. Many wholesalers are now working with Amazon FBA sellers as a core part of their business. Would you be open to making an exception, or is there a specific requirement I can meet to qualify?"

---

## NEXT STEPS:

1. ✅ Choose 10 wholesalers from your database to contact first
2. ✅ Send initial outreach emails (customize templates above)
3. ✅ Follow up with phone calls 2-3 days later
4. ✅ Collect catalogs and pricing
5. ✅ Match products to ASINs (see UPC Matching Guide)
6. ✅ Request authorization letters for gated brands
7. ✅ Place sample orders
8. ✅ Scale to full orders once validated

**Timeline**: Expect 1-2 weeks from initial outreach to first order placement for most responsive suppliers.
